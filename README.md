# weight-plate-calculator

A simple command line tool to calculate the plates that should be added to a 45lb bar to set it to the desired total weight.

Future enhancements include:

1. Allowing the weight of the bar to be changed
2. Allowing the user to enter the plates that they have (the hard-coded weights are the set that I have)
3. Allowing the user to use metric kilograms in addition to U.S. lbs.
